# Laurance Walden: professional positioning plan for the AI era

**Your online presence has strong foundations but critical execution gaps that need immediate attention.** The good news: your technical background (12 years of C#/.NET/Azure) combined with genuine AI/agentic systems interest places you in one of the most underserved and high-value content niches in software engineering. The .NET + AI intersection is a blue ocean — nearly all agentic AI content today is Python-centric, and the audience of enterprise .NET developers hungry for practical AI integration content is large and growing. This plan gives you a concrete, automation-first system to establish authority as a serious builder of AI-integrated systems over the next 2-3 years, positioning you for consulting and contract work post-retirement.

## Part 1: Current profile audit and critical fixes

### Your personal site is invisible to Google

Your portfolio at **lwalden.github.io** is well-designed with strong content choices — the AI Agent Minder project is compelling, the About section bridges .NET expertise with AI interests effectively, and the two Medium articles cover timely topics. However, **Google still indexes the site with the stale title "MiSnap 4.2.0 - Mitek Systems Integration Example"** from a previous use of the GitHub Pages domain. Searching "Laurance Walden software engineer" returns your LinkedIn and GitHub but not your personal site. Your Medium articles have **zero search engine visibility** — they don't appear for any search query, including their exact titles.

**What's missing from the site:** No professional experience section (12 years of enterprise work is invisible), no testimonials or social proof, no skills/technology matrix, no certifications, no structured data markup, and all writing lives on Medium rather than on the site itself. The title "Backend Engineer & Tech Lead" doesn't match your actual "Senior Software Engineer" role, creating potential credibility issues.

**Immediate fixes (do this week):**
- Update `<title>`, `<meta description>`, and add `<meta name="robots">` tags with proper keywords
- Submit the site to Google Search Console and request re-indexing
- Add JSON-LD Person schema markup for rich search results
- Register a custom domain (laurancewalden.dev or similar) — GitHub Pages supports this natively and it dramatically improves SEO authority
- Align your title consistently across all platforms: **"Senior Software Engineer | .NET & Azure | AI & Agentic Systems"**

### Your GitHub profile has embarrassing gaps

Your GitHub profile has a **typo in the website URL** — it reads "lwalden.guthub.io" instead of "lwalden.github.io." This broken link is the first thing many visitors will notice. Beyond that, you have **no profile README** (the special lwalden/lwalden repository), **no bio text**, and several trivial repositories (dice-roller, HostingOnGitHub) diluting the professional signal. The airdrop-architect repo description just repeats the repo name.

Your AIAgentMinder is correctly pinned first and its description is solid, but with only **2 stars** and **16 followers** total, the social proof is thin for someone with 12 years of experience. You do have the Arctic Code Vault Contributor achievement, which is a nice credibility signal.

**Immediate fixes:**
- Fix the website URL typo (literally a 5-second edit)
- Create a profile README (lwalden/lwalden repo) with: professional bio, tech stack badges (C#, .NET, Azure, AI), featured projects with descriptions, links to your portfolio/LinkedIn/Medium
- Write proper descriptions for all repos, especially airdrop-architect
- Unpin dice-roller and HostingOnGitHub — pin only AIAgentMinder, airdrop-architect, lwalden.github.io, and life
- Add topic tags to all repos for discoverability

### LinkedIn is your strongest asset but needs optimization

Your LinkedIn profile is the **#1 search result** for "Laurance Walden software engineer" — this is good. You appear to be actively posting (a recent post about "Boosting Claude Code Productivity with Context" was found). However, there may be a **duplicate/legacy profile** at linkedin.com/in/laurance-walden-5581914 that could cause confusion. If this exists, consolidate or delete it.

**LinkedIn optimization priorities:**
- **Headline formula:** "Senior Software Engineer | C#/.NET/Azure (12 Years) | Building AI-Integrated Enterprise Systems | Agentic AI & MCP" — include searchable keywords recruiters and peers actually look for
- **About section:** Structure in 4 paragraphs — (1) hook + specialization, (2) 2-3 quantified achievements from your career, (3) your approach to AI integration and what you're building, (4) what you're looking for and a call to action
- **Featured section:** Pin 3-6 items — AIAgentMinder repo, your best Medium article, your portfolio site, and any notable project demos
- Take LinkedIn's Skills Assessments for relevant topics — verified badges now weigh more in recruiter searches

### Medium needs volume and distribution

Two articles in February 2026 is a start, but **two articles does not establish thought leadership**. The topics are excellent (co-developing with Claude, Opus 4.6 review), and writing about building tools for AI development positions you as a practitioner. But the articles are self-published rather than submitted to publications, which is why they have near-zero distribution.

**Medium strategy:**
- Submit articles to established publications: **Better Programming**, **Towards Data Science**, **AI in Plain English**, or **Level Up Coding** — these have massive built-in audiences and dramatically boost visibility
- Optimize titles for search: "Claude Code Tutorial: Building AI Agent Governance in C#" performs better than narrative titles
- Use all 5 available tags strategically on every article
- Complete your Medium bio with professional positioning and links

### Other findings about your digital footprint

Your name returns **zero results** when searched with "Columbia Sportswear" — your 12 years of enterprise experience is entirely invisible online. A stale Codecademy profile at codecademy.com/lwalden shows up in results, potentially diluting your brand. You have no presence on X/Twitter, Stack Overflow, Dev.to, or YouTube. Your Instagram (climb.on.lw) exists as a personal account — it's fine to keep it separate, but consider adding "Software Engineer" to the bio for any crossover visitors.

## Part 2: The .NET + AI content niche is wide open

### Why this positioning is exceptionally valuable right now

**Agentic AI is the dominant technology trend of 2025-2026.** IBM predicts **40% of enterprise applications** will leverage AI agents by 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025. The market is projected to grow from $5-7 billion to $50-200 billion by 2030-2034. MCP (Model Context Protocol) has become, as The New Stack describes it, "almost as popular as running a web server."

Here's what matters for your positioning: **nearly all agentic AI content is Python-first**. LangChain, CrewAI, and LangGraph dominate tutorials and thought leadership. The .NET developer community — which is enormous in enterprise settings — has almost no high-quality, practitioner-led content on AI integration. This is your unfair advantage. You're not competing with thousands of Python AI influencers; you're filling a genuine gap where enterprise .NET developers are actively searching for guidance.

### The Microsoft Agent Framework gap is your biggest opportunity

Microsoft released the **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** in public preview in October 2025, with GA targeted for Q1 2026. MAF unifies Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into one production-focused framework with graph-based workflows, MCP/A2A support, Azure AI Foundry integration, and enterprise-grade observability. Enterprise customers including BMW, KPMG, and Fujitsu are already running production workloads on it.

**Very few content creators are producing hands-on .NET-specific agentic AI tutorials.** This is a massive content gap that aligns perfectly with your skills. Other severely underserved areas include:

- **Semantic Kernel advanced patterns** — basic "getting started" exists, but enterprise-grade multi-agent orchestration content is essentially absent
- **MCP Server implementations in C#** — nearly all MCP examples are Python/TypeScript
- **Azure AI Foundry practical walkthroughs** — the platform evolves monthly and the documentation-to-tutorial gap is huge
- **AI agent testing and evaluation in .NET** — almost no content exists on this topic
- **Microsoft.Extensions.AI + Semantic Kernel architecture patterns** — how these frameworks work together is poorly understood

### Content themes that position you as a builder, not a hype creator

The distinction between "builder" and "hype creator" content is clear. Builder content shows working code with GitHub repos, discusses trade-offs and failures honestly, includes performance metrics and costs, and features architecture diagrams with reasoning. Hype content shows ChatGPT screenshots, uses "this changes everything!" headlines, makes vague productivity claims, and ignores production realities.

**Your content pillars should be:**

1. **"I built this with .NET + Azure AI"** — always show working systems, link to repos, share real cost data from Azure consumption
2. **Architecture decision records** — "Why I chose Semantic Kernel over raw Azure OpenAI SDK" with technical reasoning
3. **Honest assessments of AI tools in enterprise .NET workflows** — 90% of engineering teams now use AI coding tools, but honest, data-backed evaluations are rare
4. **Enterprise concerns** — security, compliance, observability, and cost control for AI systems, which are topics the hype creators never touch
5. **AI agent governance** — you're already building AIAgentMinder, which is directly relevant to the industry's emerging need for agent lifecycle management

### Topics that build your consulting pipeline

For post-retirement consulting and contract work, these topics position you for the highest-value engagements: enterprise AI integration architecture (companies need people who understand existing .NET/Azure infrastructure AND AI capabilities), agentic AI implementation (consultancies are hiring aggressively for these skills), AI-augmented SDLC consulting (helping organizations implement AI coding tools and measure productivity), and Azure AI Foundry migration. **Billing rates for AI + .NET consulting currently range from $100-200+/hour**, and independent consultants with enterprise .NET + AI skills are in extreme demand.

## Part 3: Platform-by-platform content strategy

### LinkedIn — your primary professional platform

LinkedIn's algorithm now rewards **topic authority** — it identifies subject-matter experts and boosts their content within that niche. Consistency in one area is rewarded more than broad posting. This works perfectly for your positioning.

**Posting cadence:** 2-3 posts per week, Tuesday-Thursday, between 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM Pacific. The first 60 minutes after posting are critical — engaging with early comments within 30 minutes generates **64% more total comments and 2.3x more views**. Spend 15-20 minutes daily leaving substantive comments on 5-10 posts from others in your niche; this is as valuable as posting.

**Content formats ranked by 2025 algorithm performance:** (1) Carousels/PDF documents — highest-performing format, (2) text-only posts over 1,500 characters, (3) polls for engagement. Video reach has dropped approximately 200% year-over-year on LinkedIn — deprioritize it. **Never put links in the post body** — LinkedIn penalizes external links with ~30% reach reduction. Put links in the first comment instead. Use 3-5 hashtags maximum; more triggers spam filters.

**Critical algorithm note for 2025-2026:** Overall organic reach is down significantly (views down ~50%, engagement down ~25%, follower growth down ~59% per Richard van der Blom's 2025 research). AI-generated content is being actively filtered. Your authentic practitioner perspective is a genuine advantage here — write from experience, not from templates.

### X/Twitter — your real-time tech conversation layer

X remains powerful for tech professionals, particularly for real-time conversations, building in public, and engaging with the developer community. It complements LinkedIn rather than replacing it.

**Growth strategy:** Start with the **reply-first approach** — consistently add value in comments on larger accounts' posts in the .NET, Azure, and AI engineering space. Their followers discover you. This is the fastest path to building a following. Aim for 1 original post per day plus engagement on 10-15 other posts. Threads (4-8 tweets) are the most powerful format for growth — use them for tutorials, case studies, and framework breakdowns.

**Profile setup:** Use your real name as handle for cross-platform consistency. Clear bio with niche keywords ("Senior .NET Engineer | Building AI agents with Azure & Semantic Kernel | 12 years enterprise systems"). Link to your portfolio. Professional photo. Relevant banner.

### Medium and technical writing — your depth layer

The ideal cadence is **2 articles per month minimum**, building to weekly as your automation pipeline matures. Optimal article length is **1,500-2,500 words** — posts over 2,000 words rank higher in Google and generate more shares. Medium's high domain authority means optimized articles can outrank personal blogs in search results.

**Platform strategy:** Don't rely exclusively on Medium. Publish the canonical version on your personal site, then cross-post to Medium (with canonical URL set), Dev.to or Hashnode (for developer community credibility), and as LinkedIn Articles. This creates multiple discovery paths for each piece of content while building your personal domain's authority.

**Article types that perform well:** "How I built X" case studies with real metrics, framework comparisons with data, system design deep-dives, developer productivity and tooling evaluations, and failure postmortems ("what went wrong and what I learned").

### Faceless YouTube — your authority amplifier

A faceless tech YouTube channel focused on .NET + AI is achievable with **2-3 hours per video** and serves as a powerful authority-building and consulting lead generation tool. The channel's primary value is not ad revenue — a channel with even 5,000-10,000 highly targeted subscribers in the .NET/Azure AI niche is worth more for generating consulting leads than a 100,000-subscriber general programming channel.

**Format recommendation:** Screen recordings of actual development work (IDE, terminal, Azure portal) with voiceover — either your own voice cleaned up with Descript, or an ElevenLabs voice clone for consistency. This is not a generic stock-footage channel; it's an engineer sharing their screen, which aligns with the "builder" brand.

**Optimal video length:** 8-15 minutes as the core format (enables mid-roll ads, maximizes completion rates), supplemented by 30-60 second Shorts for discovery. The Shorts drive subscribers; long-form drives revenue and authority.

**Video content types ranked by suitability:**
- Screen recording code walkthroughs (8-15 min) — "Building an AI Agent with Semantic Kernel"
- Quick concept explainers (1-3 min) — "MCP in 100 Seconds," "What is Azure AI Foundry?"
- Architecture explainers with diagrams (5-10 min) — "How I Architected a Multi-Agent Enterprise System"
- Comparison videos (5-8 min) — "Semantic Kernel vs. Raw Azure OpenAI SDK"

**Production tool stack:** OBS Studio (free, screen capture), ElevenLabs ($5-22/mo, AI voiceover/voice cloning), DaVinci Resolve (free, professional editing), Excalidraw (free, architecture diagrams), Canva (free/pro, thumbnails), TubeBuddy or VidIQ (SEO optimization).

**Posting cadence:** 1 long-form video per week + 2-3 Shorts. Cross-post Shorts to LinkedIn for B2B visibility.

## Part 4: The automation pipeline — maximum output, minimum effort

### The recommended tool stack ($25-30/month)

For a senior engineer comfortable with self-hosting, the most powerful and cost-effective setup combines **n8n** (self-hosted workflow automation), **Typefully** (LinkedIn + X writing interface), and **Claude/OpenAI APIs** (AI-assisted content generation).

| Component | Tool | Monthly cost |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Workflow automation | n8n (self-hosted on $5/mo VPS) | $5 |
| LinkedIn + X composing/scheduling | Typefully Starter | $8 |
| AI content APIs | Claude API + OpenAI API | $10-15 |
| Medium cross-posting | n8n → Medium API | Free |
| YouTube scheduling | n8n → YouTube API | Free |
| Comment management | Buffer Community (free tier) | Free |
| **Total** | | **~$25-30/mo** |

n8n is the clear winner for your skill set because it's self-hostable (free forever on your own server), has built-in LangChain integration for sophisticated AI workflows, supports custom JavaScript/Python code nodes, can be version-controlled via Git, and has pre-built workflow templates for content distribution.

### The weekly content pipeline (target: 3-4 hours per week)

**Step 1 — Write one core piece (90-120 minutes, weekly):**
Use Claude to brainstorm topics and generate an outline based on your .NET/Azure/AI work. Write the article yourself with genuine technical insights — AI polishes, you provide the substance. Publish to your personal site/blog as the canonical source.

**Step 2 — Automated distribution (zero manual effort):**
An n8n workflow triggers on your blog's RSS feed, detects new posts, and automatically: (1) calls the Claude API to generate a LinkedIn post version (professional tone, 1,300 characters), (2) generates an X/Twitter thread version (5-7 tweets), (3) cross-posts to Medium via its API with canonical URL, (4) creates a YouTube community post summary, and (5) logs everything to Google Sheets for tracking. A pre-built n8n template called "Automate RSS content to blog posts with GPT-4o, WordPress & LinkedIn publishing" does almost exactly this and can be adapted.

**Step 3 — Engagement (15-20 minutes daily):**
Use Buffer Community's unified inbox to monitor comments across LinkedIn and X. Respond only to high-value comments. AI-suggested replies handle routine responses. Platform-native filters auto-hide spam on LinkedIn and YouTube.

**Step 4 — Monthly content recycling (30 minutes, monthly):**
Review analytics to identify top-performing posts. Use n8n to auto-generate AI variations of evergreen content and reschedule for redistribution. Update old Medium articles with current data and add "2026" to titles to keep them ranking.

### Alternative cross-posting tools worth noting

**For a simpler setup** if n8n feels like too much infrastructure: **Typefully** ($8-24/mo) handles LinkedIn + X cross-posting with a clean writing interface and AI assistant. **Buffer** ($5/channel/mo) covers YouTube + broader social with a Community feature for comment management. **Publer** ($5/mo) offers RSS feed automation and bulk scheduling at the lowest price point. **Micro.blog** ($5/mo) is a hidden gem — it hosts your own microblog with built-in cross-posting to Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn, and Mastodon. **dlvr.it** (free for 50 posts/mo) is the simplest RSS-to-social tool if you just want your blog posts automatically shared.

**For video content repurposing:** **OpusClip** clips long YouTube videos into viral Shorts automatically. **Descript** ($16/mo) lets you edit video by editing a text transcript and can turn tutorials into blog posts + short clips.

## Part 5: The 24-month execution roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundation repair (weeks 1-4)

Fix every critical issue identified in the audit. This is non-negotiable groundwork.

**Week 1:** Fix GitHub website typo. Update personal site meta tags and submit to Google Search Console. Create GitHub profile README with bio, tech stack badges, and featured projects. Register custom domain (laurancewalden.dev).

**Week 2:** Optimize LinkedIn headline and About section. Consolidate or delete duplicate LinkedIn profile. Update Featured section with AIAgentMinder, portfolio site, and best Medium article. Complete Medium bio.

**Week 3:** Set up n8n on a VPS. Configure Typefully account. Build the RSS-to-social automation workflow. Set up Buffer Community for engagement monitoring. Clean up GitHub — proper descriptions on all repos, unpin trivial projects, add topic tags.

**Week 4:** Write and publish your first SEO-optimized article through the full pipeline. Test the automated distribution. Adjust the workflow based on results. Submit the article to a Medium publication (Better Programming or AI in Plain English).

### Phase 2 — Content momentum (months 2-6)

**Weekly rhythm:** 1 long-form article or tutorial (90-120 minutes writing), 2-3 LinkedIn posts (auto-generated from article + manual), 1 X/Twitter thread (auto-generated), daily 15-minute engagement. **Monthly:** 1 YouTube video (8-15 minutes, 2-3 hours production). Submit every Medium article to a publication.

**Content focus during this phase:** Microsoft Agent Framework tutorials in C#, Semantic Kernel advanced patterns, MCP Server implementations in .NET, Azure AI Foundry practical walkthroughs, honest AI coding tool evaluations for enterprise .NET workflows.

**Growth targets by month 6:** 10-12 published articles, 4-6 YouTube videos, LinkedIn following growth of 500+, GitHub followers doubled, Medium articles appearing in Google search results.

### Phase 3 — Authority building (months 7-18)

Increase YouTube to 2 videos per month. Begin creating YouTube Shorts (2-3 per week) from existing long-form content using OpusClip. Start a lightweight newsletter (Substack or Buttondown) to build a direct audience you own — pipe subscribers from all platforms. Pitch guest posts to .NET-focused publications and blogs. Apply to speak at virtual conferences or meetups (NDC, .NET Conf, local Azure user groups).

**Content evolution:** Move from tutorials toward thought leadership — architectural opinions, industry analysis from a practitioner's perspective, predictions about enterprise AI adoption. Share more about your AIAgentMinder project's evolution as a case study in building AI governance tools.

**Growth targets by month 18:** 30+ published articles, 15+ YouTube videos with 1,000+ subscribers, recognized within the .NET + AI community, inbound consulting inquiries beginning.

### Phase 4 — Monetization and transition (months 19-24)

Formalize consulting offerings on your website. Create a "services" page targeting enterprise AI integration architecture, agentic AI implementation, and Azure AI Foundry migration consulting. Build a portfolio of case studies from your content and projects. Consider creating a paid course or digital product (e.g., "Enterprise AI Integration with .NET: From Zero to Production"). Leverage YouTube and newsletter audience for direct consulting lead generation.

**Revenue streams by priority:** Consulting leads (highest value at $100-200+/hr), sponsored content from developer tool companies ($30-50 CPM), digital products, YouTube ad revenue, affiliate partnerships.

## Conclusion: what makes this plan work

Three things separate this plan from generic "build your brand" advice. First, **the niche is genuinely underserved** — .NET + AI content is a blue ocean where you won't be competing with thousands of Python AI influencers, and the enterprise audience is large, loyal, and willing to pay for consulting. Second, **the automation pipeline means the marginal cost of each additional piece of content drops toward zero** — you write one core article per week and the system distributes it across five platforms with platform-appropriate formatting. Third, **everything you publish doubles as a consulting portfolio piece** — every tutorial, architecture diagram, and honest tool evaluation demonstrates exactly the expertise companies will pay $150+/hour for.

The most important insight from this research is that **your existing skills are the strategy**. You don't need to become a content creator; you need to make your engineering work visible. The difference between your current online presence and a commanding one is not talent or knowledge — it's fixing a typo on GitHub, submitting articles to publications instead of self-publishing, and spending 3-4 focused hours per week feeding a pipeline that does the rest automatically.
