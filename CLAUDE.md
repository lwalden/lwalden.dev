# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

> Claude reads this file automatically at the start of every session.
> Keep it concise -- every line costs context tokens.
>
> **Reading order:** PROGRESS.md first → DECISIONS.md before architectural choices → other docs on-demand.

## Session Protocol

### Starting a Session
1. Read `PROGRESS.md` -- understand current state, active tasks, and priorities
2. Check `git status` for uncommitted work
3. Resume from "Next Priorities" in PROGRESS.md

> If no session context was injected above (you don't see PROGRESS.md content), read PROGRESS.md and DECISIONS.md manually before proceeding.

### During a Session
- Write code to files immediately -- don't accumulate changes in memory
- Commit at natural checkpoints (compiles, tests pass, logical unit complete)
- Prefer smaller, frequent commits over one large commit
- Use Claude's native Tasks for complex multi-step work; keep PROGRESS.md as the durable record

### Ending a Session
Run `/handoff` to write a clear briefing for the next session. Hooks handle timestamp and auto-commit automatically.

## Project Identity

**Project:** lwalden-site
**Description:** Personal portfolio site and blog for Laurance Walden — Senior Software Engineer specializing in .NET, Azure, and AI-integrated enterprise systems, deployed to Azure Static Web Apps at lwalden.dev
**Type:** web-app
**Stack:** Astro (blog template), TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS, Azure Static Web Apps, Shiki syntax highlighting
**MCP Servers:** context7 (Astro/Tailwind live docs), sequential-thinking (complex task planning)

**Developer Profile:**
- Senior software engineer, 12 years C#/.NET/Azure enterprise experience
- Aggressive autonomy — Claude may scaffold, build, install, branch, and PR without asking

## MVP Goals

<!-- Populated by /plan with Phase 1 deliverables -->

## Behavioral Rules

### Git Workflow
- **Never commit directly to main** -- always use feature branches
- Branch naming: `feature/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `chore/short-description`
- All changes via PR. Claude creates PRs; human reviews and merges

### Credentials
- Never store credentials in code. Use `.env` files (gitignored).

### Autonomy Boundaries
**You CAN autonomously:** Create files, install packages, run builds/tests, create branches and PRs, scaffold code
**Ask the human first:** Create GitHub repos, merge PRs, sign up for services, provide API keys, approve major architectural changes

### Verification-First Development
- Confirm requirements before implementing
- Write tests appropriate to the project's quality tier (see strategy-roadmap.md)
- When Standard tier or above: write failing tests first, then implement

## Context Budget

| File | Target Size | Action if Exceeded |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| CLAUDE.md | ~75 lines | Don't add without removing something |
| PROGRESS.md | ~20 lines active | Self-trimming: only 3 session notes kept |
| DECISIONS.md | Grows over time | Delete superseded entries (git history preserves them) |

**Reading Strategy:**
- PROGRESS.md: Every session (auto-injected by hook)
- DECISIONS.md: Auto-injected if decisions exist; always check before architectural choices
- strategy-roadmap.md: On-demand
