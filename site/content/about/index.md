Software developer building enterprise cloud and distributed systems. Building at the intersection of cloud software engineering and agentic AI — writing about trade-offs and sharing what actually works in production.

I'm a software developer with over a decade of experience building enterprise-grade distributed systems in C#, .NET, and Azure. Most of that work lives in the invisible layer of large organizations — the APIs, pipelines, and services that quietly keep things running. I like it there. There's something satisfying about infrastructure that works so well nobody notices it.

Across roles in ecommerce, DAM and Digital Content Management, and identity verification I've worked on everything from greenfield to legacy — optimizing systems and automating manual labor out of the hands of creatives. The pattern that keeps showing up: find the thing that's slow, fragile, or tedious, and make it not that.

Right now my focus is on Agentic AI and how these tools will change how we do software development. Along the way I get to practice with different languages, tech stacks, integrations, and patterns.

I write here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lwalden). If you're working on .NET + AI systems, Claude Code governance, or just want to compare notes on the space, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurancewalden/).
