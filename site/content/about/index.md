Senior software engineer with 12 years building enterprise cloud and distributed systems. Building at the intersection of cloud software engineering and agentic AI — writing about trade-offs and sharing what actually works in production.

I'm a senior software engineer with over a decade of experience building enterprise-grade distributed systems in C#, .NET, and Azure. Most of that work lives in the invisible layer of large organizations — the APIs, pipelines, and services that quietly keep things running. I like it there. There's something satisfying about infrastructure that works so well nobody notices it.

Across roles in retail, HR tech, and identity verification I've shipped production systems where reliability isn't optional. Highlights include cutting a multi-step workflow's processing time by 96% (6 minutes to 12 seconds), reducing daily failed transactions from 2,000 to under one, and automating away over 1,000 hours of annual manual labor. The pattern that keeps showing up: find the thing that's slow, fragile, or tedious, and make it not that.

Right now my focus is the intersection of .NET and agentic AI. I'm building [AIAgentMinder](https://github.com/lwalden/AIAgentMinder) — a governance framework for AI agents in enterprise .NET systems — and writing about what it actually takes to put AI into production. Not the happy-path demos, but the real questions: audit trails, lifecycle management, failure modes, and the organizational constraints nobody's talking about yet.

I write here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lwalden). If you're working on .NET + AI systems or just want to compare notes on the space, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurancewalden/).
