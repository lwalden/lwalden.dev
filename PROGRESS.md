# PROGRESS.md - Session Continuity

> Claude reads this FIRST every session. When adding a session note, keep only the 3 most recent -- drop older ones (git history is the archive).

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-27 15:15

## Active Tasks
- Begin Phase 1 site build

## Current State
- Planning complete: SPEC.md, positioning plan, and strategy-roadmap.md all present
- No Astro project scaffolded yet — zero code exists
- DECISIONS.md seeded with 4 ADRs (framework, hosting, styling, domain)

## Blockers
- None

## Next Priorities
1. Scaffold Astro project with blog template + TypeScript strict
2. Install dependencies (tailwind, sitemap, rss, astro-seo, schema-dts)
3. Implement BaseHead.astro with full SEO/OG/JSON-LD
4. Build all pages with seed content per SPEC.md
5. Add staticwebapp.config.json and GitHub Actions workflow

<!-- Session notes: keep last 3. Older ones are in git history. For decisions that matter beyond 3 sessions, use DECISIONS.md instead. Format: - [DATE] Phase [N]: [what was accomplished]. Key files: [files touched]. → [what's next] -->
- [2026-02-27] Phase 1: Ran /plan. Roadmap written, DECISIONS.md seeded (4 ADRs), PROGRESS.md and CLAUDE.md MVP Goals updated. Key files: docs/strategy-roadmap.md, DECISIONS.md, CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md. → Ready to scaffold Astro project.
