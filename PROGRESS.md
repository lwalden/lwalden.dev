# PROGRESS.md - Session Continuity

> Claude reads this FIRST every session. When adding a session note, keep only the 3 most recent -- drop older ones (git history is the archive).

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

## Active Tasks
- Project initialization (Run /setup then /plan)

## Current State
- [Brief description of what's working, what's partially done, what's broken]

## Blockers
- None yet

## Next Priorities
1. Run /setup -- Initialize with actual values
2. Run /plan -- Create strategy roadmap
3. Begin Phase 1

<!-- Session notes: keep last 3. Older ones are in git history. For decisions that matter beyond 3 sessions, use DECISIONS.md instead. Format: - [DATE] Phase [N]: [what was accomplished]. Key files: [files touched]. → [what's next] -->
