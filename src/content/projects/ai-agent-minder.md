As AI agents move from demos to production systems, organizations face a new category of problem: how do you manage, monitor, and govern agents that can take autonomous actions on your behalf?

AIAgentMinder is my attempt to build practical tooling for this problem in the .NET ecosystem. The goal is a framework that gives enterprise teams the controls they need to deploy AI agents with confidence — audit trails, lifecycle management, policy enforcement, and observability.

## Why this exists

Most agent frameworks focus on capability (what the agent can do) and assume someone else will handle governance (who authorized it, what it changed, how it can be rolled back). That assumption doesn't hold in enterprise environments where compliance, audit, and change management are real constraints.
