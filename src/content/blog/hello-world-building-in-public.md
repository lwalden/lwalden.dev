****AI AUTOGENERATE BLOG POST PLACHOLDER****

After 12 years of building enterprise systems with C# and Azure, most of my work has been invisible to the outside world. That changes now.

<!-- TODO: Replace this content with your own voice. The outline below is a starting point. -->

## What I've been doing

I've spent over a decade at a large enterprise retailer building and maintaining the software that quietly keeps a global retail operation running — APIs, integrations, event-driven pipelines, the kind of systems where failure has a dollar cost and reliability is non-negotiable.

That work taught me a lot about what it actually takes to build software at scale. But almost none of it is visible online, which is a problem if you're positioning yourself for consulting or trying to contribute to the broader .NET community.

## What's changing

The .NET + AI space is moving fast and it's almost entirely underserved by content. Most agentic AI tutorials assume you're writing Python. The enterprise .NET developer who wants to integrate Semantic Kernel, MCP, or Azure AI Foundry into an existing system has very few practical resources.

That's the gap I'm writing for.

## What I'll be covering

- Practical .NET + AI integration — not hello-world demos, but the architectural decisions you'd actually face
- Semantic Kernel, MCP server implementations in C#, Azure AI Foundry
- AI agent governance and lifecycle management (my current project: [AIAgentMinder](https://github.com/lwalden/AIAgentMinder))
- Honest tool evaluations — what works, what doesn't, what the hidden costs are

## Why here instead of just Medium

Medium is a distribution channel. This blog is the canonical source. Everything I write will live here first, with canonical URLs pointing back, so the SEO authority builds on lwalden.dev rather than on someone else's platform.

More coming soon.
